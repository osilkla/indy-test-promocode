## INSIGHT ?
- I would type my code more precisely (ts)
- I would test at least the 2 golden paths with EE test 'a user can create a promo code' and 'a user can verify the validity of a promocode' 
- I would mutualize some logic and errors handling, and delete some if/else logic that can be early returned
- I should use UUID instead of a fixed '1' id for promotion_code
- I did'nt implement the weather api because ...
- I lost a lot of time on project/mac setup and typescript setup, i'm little bit rusted on node and blank project but...
- It was a good test with nice features i enjoyed it !!
